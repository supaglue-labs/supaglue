# Writing data

Supaglue supports APIs and a beta SDK client for writing data to third-party providers.

## APIs

Supaglue supports three ways to write data to the underlying third-party providers:

1. **Unified API**: Write to multiple third-party providers with a single API for [`crm`](../api/v2/crm/unified-crm-api) and [`engagement`](../api/v2/engagement/unified-engagement-api).
1. [**Actions API**](../api/v2/actions/actions-api): Write to provider-scoped APIs that range from CRUD to complex actions.
1. [**Passthrough**](../api/v2/actions/send-passthrough-request): Call underlying native third-party provider APIs using credentials managed by Supaglue.

## Unified SDK Clients (beta)

Supaglue supports Unified SDK Clients for `crm`. Similar to Unified APIs, Unified SDK Clients provide a single interface to write to multiple third-party providers. However, developers can fork or generate new unified clients, which makes them more flexible than Unified APIs.

Please reach out to ([team@supaglue.com](mailto:team@supaglue.com)) if you'd like early access to these clients.
