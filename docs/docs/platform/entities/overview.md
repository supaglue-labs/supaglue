**Entities** have a 1-n relationship between your application object and Provider object. As the developer, you define the object-object and field-field relationships between your application and Providers.

Entities differ from [Objects](../objects/overview): Objects only have a 1-1 relationship between your application and Provider objects.

Entities differ from [Common Schema](../common-schema/overview): While Common Schema objects have a 1-n relationship between your application and Provider objects, Supaglue determines the normalization.
