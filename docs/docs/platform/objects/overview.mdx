# Standard Objects

Not every object in a remote provider is supported by Supaglue's common schema or is unifiable across providers. In addition to common objects, there are object provider-specific concepts that don't exist elsewhere. In these situations, you can access Standard Objects from 3rd party providers in their native, unnormalized format.

Supaglue Standard Objects are pre-defined objects in third-party providers, e.g. `Contacts`, `Accounts`, and `Leads` are pre-defined objects in Salesforce and are Standard Objects in Supaglue.
Standard Objects have a 1-1 relationship between your application and Provider objects. For example, a `Contact` in Salesforce is a `salesforce_Contact` in your application, and a Hubspot `company` is a `hubspot_company` in your application.

You can use Standard Objects as part of [Managed Syncs](../../integration-patterns/managed-syncs).

## Configuration

Use the **Syncs --> Sync Configs** page in the Management Portal to specify the Standard Objects you wish to sync to your Destination.

</BrowserWindow>

The screenshot above shows a HubSpot Sync Config that specifies `product`, `contact`, `contact`, `deal`, and `email` Standard Objects. Supaglue will sync these Standard Objects.

## Object names

Since Standard Objects vary by Provider, you need to select the Standard Objects separately for each Provider. The casing of the Standard Objects is also provider-specific, e.g. Standard Objects for Salesforce are "PascalCase".

## Table names

Tables are case-sensitive and named `${Provider}_${Object name}`, e.g. `salesforce_Account`.

## Table schema

Supaglue will land the data in your Destination with the following schema:

```
postgres=> \d "salesforce_Contract"
                             Table "public.salesforce_Contract"
          Column          |              Type              | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
