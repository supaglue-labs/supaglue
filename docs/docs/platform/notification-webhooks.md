# Notification webhooks

You can configure Supaglue to fire webhooks to your application when certain system events occur. These webhooks don't contain Provider data but are used to notify your application or trigger related workflows.

For example, you can configure a webhook to fire when new connections get created or when managed syncs finish. Some of the things you can do with webhooks include:

- Notify customers when initial syncs complete
- Display appropriate UI upon connection success or failure
- Trigger data transformation workflows are new data syncs to your database

Configure webhook notifications via the Management Portal.
