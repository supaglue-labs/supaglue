# Quickstart

This quickstart will show you how to integrate Supaglue with your application in approximately 10 minutes. By the end, you will have synced data from a sample customer's Hubspot to your Postgres database and queried it.

## 1. Create your Supaglue account

Create a free Supaglue Cloud account **[here](https://app.supaglue.io/sign-up)**.

## 2. Configure a provider

[**Providers**](./category/providers) are the third-party SaaS platforms that your customers use, that you are integrating with. Supaglue supports a growing catalog of providers across multiple categories.

Navigate to the **Connectors -> Providers** tab and click Configure on HubSpot. Toggle on "Managed OAuth2 App".

</BrowserWindow>

:::info
For convenience, we offer Supaglue-managed OAuth apps for certain providers if you don't have one yourself. We highly recommend using your own OAuth app for production.
:::

## 3. Configure destination

Supaglue syncs data from providers to [**Destinations**](./category/destinations) of your choice. For convenience, we'll use Supaglue's managed destination in this quickstart.

1. Navigate to the **Connectors -> Destinations** tab and click enable on "Supaglue".

## 4. Define a sync configuration

[**Sync Config**](./integration-patterns/managed-syncs#syncconfig) define which objects to sync from a Provider to a Destination, and how frequently.

1. Go to the **Sync Configs** tab and click the "Add" button to add a new Sync Config.
1. Select the Provider and Destination you configured earlier, then under "Common objects" select `contact`, and click "Save".

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.supaglue.io/applications/62605dc1-148e-4c53-a850-82e10f71ed23/configuration/sync_configs/e8a88575-efdb-4560-ae94-3871e8e51b18">

## 5. Register a customer

A **Customer** is an end user in your application who connects their third-party SaaS provider to your application using Supaglue's [Managed Authentication](./platform/managed-auth).

1. Navigate to the Customers page and click on the plus button to create a sample customer:
   - customer_id: `1234` (the primary key you use in your application that uniquely identifies this customer)
   - name: `Jane Doe`
   - email: `jane@acmecorp.com`

<BrowserWindow url="https://app.supaglue.io/applications/62605dc1-148e-4c53-a850-82e10f71ed23/customers">

</BrowserWindow>

## 6. Create a connection

1. Navigate to the Customer page and click the "Embed Link" button for the customer you just registered.
1. Open a new tab in your browser and paste the URL into the URL bar. 
1. Complete the HubSpot OAuth flow, which installs the Supaglue-managed OAuth app in your HubSpot account with the requested scopes.

:::info

Typically, you would embed the Embedded Link in your application, so that your customers can establish connections in a self-serve way. Using the embedded link yourself emulates the experience your customers would experience. See [managed authentication](/platform/managed-auth) for more details.

  </div>

## 7. Query your destination

By default, managed syncs start executing as soon as new connections are created. Make a request to the [List accounts](api/v2/crm/list-accounts) Unified API endpoint to fetch Company records from your HubSpot account:

1. Generate your [API key](api/introduction#api-authentication).
1. Replace `{API_KEY}` with yours and run the following curl.

```
curl -L -X GET 'https://api.supaglue.io/crm/v2/accounts?read_from_cache=true' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'x-customer-id: 1234' \
-H 'x-provider-name: hubspot' \
-H 'x-api-key: {{API_KEY}}'
```
