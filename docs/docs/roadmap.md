# Roadmap & contributing

## Our vision

Business today rely on dozens, sometimes hundreds of SaaS tools, to run their businesses. Modern SaaS products exist within a larger ecosystem, and supporting native integrations to other tools has become a table stakes requirement.

Having built user-facing integrations ourselves, we know that building integrations can be painful and time-consuming. Our mission at Supaglue is to make building integrations fast, seamless, and extensible. Our immediate goal is to help developers ship integrations in days rather than months. We're starting with CRMs and plan to expand to other categories in the future.

Our longer-term vision is to become the connected layer for all business applications. We took an open-source approach because we believe that this connected layer should be transparent, and that open source and community contributions is the only way to support the long-tail of SaaS connectors that businesses need.

## Upcoming weeks

In the coming weeks we plan to ship:

✅  Associated objects <br />
✅  Management portal <br />
✅  Incremental reads <br />
🚧  Cloud / managed version of Supaglue <br />
🚧  Support for tasks, notes, and events in common model <br />
🚧  CDC event webhooks <br />
🚧  Client drivers <br />
🚧  API logs <br />
🚧  Metrics and alerting <br />
🚧  Sync configuration and throttling <br />
🚧  Customizable common model

## Upcoming months / quarters

We're also thinking about some longer-term projects:

- CLI
- Connector developer kit (CDK) for community contributed connectors
- More Supaglue-supported connectors
