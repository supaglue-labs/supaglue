:::info
Note: Supaglue does not sync association changes for standard objects until the relevant object gets modified in the remote provider.
:::

#### Supported CRM custom objects:

Use the internal names when configuring the `SyncConfig`. See [HubSpot's documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/crm-setup/create-custom-objects) for more information. If you created the custom object through Supaglue's API, the internal name is equivalent to the `name` field.

Syncs are Full or Incremental, and soft deletes are supported.

#### Supported Marketing Automation common objects:

- Forms

## Provider setup

import BrowserWindow from '@site/src/components/BrowserWindow';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

To connect to your customers' HubSpot instances, you'll need to update the redirect URL to point to Supaglue and fetch the API access credentials in your HubSpot developer account.

### Add Redirect URL to your HubSpot app

Supaglue provides a redirect URL to send information to your app. To add the redirect URL to your HubSpot app:

1. Log in to your HubSpot developer account (https://developers.hubspot.com)
1. Navigate to your Public Application under "Apps" and go to the "Auth" tab.

   <BrowserWindow url="app.hubspot.com/developer/12345678/application/123456">

   ![hubspot_connected_app_oauth](/img/hubspot_connected_app_oauth.png 'hubspot connected app oauth')

   </BrowserWindow>

1. Under "Redirect URLs", paste Supaglue's redirect URL:

   ```
   https://api.supaglue.io/oauth/callback
   ```

## Generate scopes

1. Check the permissions below that your application needs, to generate the HubSpot scopes you will request from your customer.

   <OAuthScopesSelector />

1. Click Save to update your changes.

:::info

Creating custom objects via the HubSpot API is restricted to OAuth apps that are part of HubSpot's pilot program. If you have this use case, you'll need to [request access](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/custom-objects-schema-pilot) to this scope.

:::

### Fetch HubSpot Public App credentials

1. Copy the Client ID, Client secret, and scopes (comma-separated), and paste them into the HubSpot configuration form in the management portal.

### Setup Webhook Configuration

You should set up the webhook configuration in Supaglue if you want to sync associations incrementally between common objects.
To do so, copy the App ID and Hubspot Developer Token and past them into the Hubspot webhook configuration in the management portal.

- You can get the App ID by navigating to your Hubspot application under "Apps" and going to the "Auth" tab.
- You can get the Hubspot Developer Token by navigating to "Apps" and clicking on "Get Hubspot API Key".
