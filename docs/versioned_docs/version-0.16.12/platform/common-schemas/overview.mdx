# Common Schema

Common Schemas are data models developed and maintained by Supaglue to make it easier to integrate with multiple providers within the same category. Supaglue maintains a common schema for each category, and maps each third-party provider API to its respective common schema(s). Common schemas can be used for both reads and writes, through managed syncs and via the unified API.

  }}
/>

## Common Object

Each Common Schema consists of a set of Common Objects that map to provider objects and fields across all providers within a category. For example, the Accounts common object in CRM maps to Salesforce Accounts and HubSpot Companies. Common Objects have a 1-N relationship between your application and provider objects.

### Configuration

In the Management Portal, go to **Syncs --> Sync Config**. Under `Common Objects` select the objects you want to sync.

<ThemedImage

  width="100%"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/salesforce-postgres-sync-config.png',
    dark: '/img/salesforce-postgres-config.png',
  }}
/>

Upon a customer going through their Oauth flow using an [Embedded Link](../managed-auth#embedded-links), Supaglue will create a Connection and start syncing the configured Common Objects to your Destination.

### Object names

Supaglue defines Common Object names using lowercase letters with snake casing. E.g. `account` and `sequence_state` for the Engagement category.

:::info
Object names are singular.
:::

### Table names

Tables are named using lowercase letters with snake casing in the following format: `${Category}_${Common Object name}s`, e.g. `engagement_accounts`.

:::info
Table names are plural.
:::

### Table schemas

Supaglue lands three categories of data in your Destination:

1. **Supaglue metadata fields**: These specify the application, customer, provider, and timestamps associated with the managed sync.
2. **Unified data (common schema fields)**: This is the unified common object data model and stored in the `_supaglue_unified_data` column. You can hoisted to top-level table columns using generated columns in `postgres` or (materialized) views in `BigQuery`.
3. **Provider-specific raw data**: The raw third-party Provider data. We pass these through as-is. This is stored in the `raw_data` (will be renamed to `_supaglue_raw_data` in the next release.) column (`jsonb`). If the unified data doesn't contain the fields you need, you can use the raw data to access the provider-specific fields directly, or hoist them using generated columsn or views just like you would for `_supaglue_unified_data`. 


Below is an example schema for the `crm_accounts` table:

```sql
postgres=> \d crm_accounts
                              Table "production.crm_accounts"
          Column          |              Type              | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------------------------+--------------------------------+-----------+----------+---------
 _supaglue_application_id | text                           |           | not null |
 _supaglue_provider_name  | text                           |           | not null |
 _supaglue_customer_id    | text                           |           | not null |
 _supaglue_emitted_at     | timestamp(3) without time zone |           | not null |
 _supaglue_unified_data   | jsonb                          |           | not null |
 raw_data                 | jsonb                          |           | not null |
 id                       | text                           |           | not null |
Indexes:
    "crm_accounts_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (_supaglue_application_id, _supaglue_provider_name, _supaglue_customer_id, id)
```

{/* TODO: add _supaglue_ prefix to `raw_data` and maybe `id` fields, to be consistent esp with provider objects */}

:::info
Please note that Supaglue metadata fields differ slightly between Common Objects and [Provider-specific Objects](../objects/overview).

## Writing

Use Supaglue's [Unified APIs](../../integration-patterns/unified-api) to write to Common Objects.
