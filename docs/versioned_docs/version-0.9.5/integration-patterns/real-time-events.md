# Real-time events (beta)

Real-time events lets you subscribe to a webhook and consume change events from your customer's CRM.

## How it works
Setting up real-time events in Supaglue only takes a few minutes:

1. Create a CRM connection.
2. Configure which objects and actions you'd like to subscribe to.
3. Host a webhook in your application.

Here's a 2 minute video that shows you how real-time events works in Salesforce.
