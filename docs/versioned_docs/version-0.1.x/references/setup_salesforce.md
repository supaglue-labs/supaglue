# Salesforce Connected App setup

To connect to your customers' Salesforce instances, you'll need to update the redirect URL to point to Supaglue and fetch the API access credentials in your [Salesforce developer account](https://developer.salesforce.com).

:::caution

1. Salesforce API access is limited to Enterprise, Unlimited, and Performance Editions of Salesforce, as well as Professional Editions with the paid API add-on. See Salesforce documentation for more information.

1. You must have the proper admin permissions on your Salesforce account to access the App Manager. If you don't, please speak to your admin.

## Add Redirect URL to your Salesforce app.

Supaglue provides a redirect URL to send information to your app. To add the redirect URL to your Salesforce app:

1. Log in to your Salesforce dashboard.

1. Navigate to the gear icon at the top of the page and click Setup.

1. In the left-hand sidebar, go to Platform Tools > Apps > App Manager.

1. Click on the registered application you'd like to use. If you don't already have one, click New Connected App.

1. Under API (Enable OAuth Settings), mark the "Enable OAuth Settings" checkbox.

1. Under Callback URL, paste Supaglue's redirect URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback
   ```

1. Select any scopes you'd like to use in your application. For the Supaglue sample application, you'll need to enable the following scopes: `id`, `api`, `refresh_token`

   <BrowserWindow url="acmecorp.my.salesforce.com/app/mgmt/forceconnectedapp/forceAppEdit.apexp">

   ![sfdc_connected_app_oauth](/img/sfdc_connected_app_oauth.png 'sfdc connected app oauth')
   </BrowserWindow>

1. Press the Save button at the bottom of the page.

## Fetch Salesforce Connected App credentials

1. Navigate to Manage Connected Apps > API (Enable OAuth Settings) > Manage Consumer Details on your Salesforce App page.

1. Copy the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, and paste them into the `apps/sample-app/.env` file as `SALESFORCE_KEY` and `SALESFORCE_SECRET`, overriding the default Salesforce credentials we've provided.

1. Re-apply the Supaglue config to have it take effect in your app:

   ```shell
   supaglue apply supaglue-config/
   ```
