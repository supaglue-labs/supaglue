# Passthrough API

Supaglue's Unified API and Managed Syncs cover most of the common integration use cases, but sometimes, you need to access provider-specific endpoints for more custom use cases. For these situations, you can use our **[Passthrough APIs](../api/v2/actions/send-passthrough-request)**, which can authenticate requests directly against the provider's API.

The Passthrough API gives you fine-grain control over your integrations while still offloading authentication and secrets management to Supaglue.
