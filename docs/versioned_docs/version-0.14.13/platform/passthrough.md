# Passthrough API

The platform features above help accelerate development time for integrations and aim at covering 80% of the most frequently occurring use cases, but they don't cover them all. For the remaining 20%, we expose **[Passthrough APIs](../api/v2/actions/send-passthrough-request)** that allow you to call the underlying Provider's native APIs.
