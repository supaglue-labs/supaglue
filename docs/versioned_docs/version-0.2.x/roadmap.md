# Roadmap & Vision

## Our vision

Business today rely on dozens, sometimes hundreds of SaaS tools, to run their businesses. Modern SaaS products exist within a larger ecosystem, and supporting native integrations to other tools has become a table stakes requirement.

Having built user-facing integrations ourselves, we know that building integrations can be painful and time-consuming. Our mission at Supaglue is to make building integrations fast, seamless, and extensible.

We aspire to let developers implement embedded SaaS integrations in their applications in 1-2 weeks rather than 4-12 weeks, using code, without having to worry about whether the tool will scale or support advanced customization as their use cases grow.

## Upcoming weeks

We started working on Supaglue in January 2023 and the project is in Public Alpha. Today, you can use Docker to run Supaglue locally and sync standard Salesforce objects from your customer's Salesforce instance to your application.

In the coming weeks we plan to ship:

**Salesforce features:**

- Bi-directional syncs
- Real-time syncs
- Incremental syncs
- Support for custom objects and custom fields
- Filters and transformations

**Developer features:**

- Developer logs and sync observability
- Server and client authentication
- Development environments
- Complete React components
- Hooks for building your own React components
- An imperative SDK for integrations

## Upcoming months / quarters

We also want top share how we're thinking about the longer-term roadmap of Supaglue.

- Managed offering
- Support for non-Salesforce integrations
- Community-contributed integrations

If there's something you like or have an idea for a feature, join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/supagluecommunity/shared_invite/zt-1o2hiozzl-ZRQswNzlT5W4sXwrQnVlDg) and let us know! We'd love to hear from you.
