# Real-time events

Real-time events let you subscribe to a webhook and consume change events from your customer's CRM. Use this for real-time notifications or real-time updates.

## How it works

Setting up real-time events in Supaglue only takes a few minutes:

1. Create a CRM connection.
2. Configure which objects and actions you'd like to subscribe to.
3. Host a webhook in your application.

Here's a 2-minute video showing how real-time events work in Salesforce.
