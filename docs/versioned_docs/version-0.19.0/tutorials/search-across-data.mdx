## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have gone through Supaglue's [Quickstart](../quickstart) using a Postgres [Destination](../category/destinations) that you host and are familiar with the following concepts:

- Postgres
- Postgres JSONB operators
- B-tree and GIN indexes

## Overview

At this point, you should have third-party Provider data synced to your Postgres database. We'll cover how to use JSONB operators and add indexes to the `raw_data` JSONB column so you can more efficiently serve queries from it.

## JSONB operators

Postgres [JSONB operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) allow you to query JSONB columns in your Postgres database. There are four ways to access JSONB data:

- Chaining the `->` operator
- Subscripting
- The `#>` operator
- Jsonpath

Here are some best practices for when to use each:

- Use the `->` operator when you want to access top-level keys in a JSONB object.
- Use Subscripting when you're accessing a nested key that is less than seven levels deep.
- Use the `#>` operator when accessing a nested key more than seven levels deep.
- Generally avoid jsonpath unless you're using a complex query.

### Example: `->` operator

```sql
SELECT raw_data->'name' from "salesforce_Contact";
```

### Example: Subscripting

```sql
SELECT raw_data['properties']['associations']['contacts'][0] from "hubspot_company";
```

### Example `#>` operator

```sql
SELECT raw_data#>'{properties,associations,contacts,0}' from "hubspot_company";
```

### Example: Jsonpath

```sql
SELECT jsonb_path_query_first(crm_contacts.email_addresses,'$[*] ? (@.email_address_type == "primary").email_address')
```
