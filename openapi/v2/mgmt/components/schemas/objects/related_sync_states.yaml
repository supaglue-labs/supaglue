      A point-in-time snapshot of whether the sync has finished. Use this to help you process your transformations in the correct order. E.g. you may want to wait for Accounts to finish before processing Contacts.

      **Note:** If syncs take longer than your specified sync frequency in your SyncConfig, you may never see finished transition be true. Please ensure that your sync frequencies are longer than sync durations.
