  summary: Create sequence state(s)
  description: |
    In other words, adding contact to sequence. Use the `record` property if you are adding a single contact, 
    and the `records` property if you are trying to add multiple contacts to a sequence at the same time (if you do, 
    you must pass in the same sequenceId, userId and mailboxId for all the contacts for this to work)
